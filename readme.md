# elm-land PWA example

## Why ?

This is to demonstrate the basic steps of turning an elm-land application into an installable PWA. This is just the beginning, you have to add offline functionality or PWA features like nofification, taking pictures and others.

## How ?

This uses the elm-land example [05-user-auth](https://github.com/elm-land/elm-land/tree/34bb0d8/examples/05-user-auth) as a starting point. If you are not familiar with it, have a look at the [turorial](https://elm.land/guide/user-auth.html) first.

We have a branch `main` where the finished result is. A branch `initial` where the original tutorial code is. And a branch `introduction-of-pwa` where every step has its own commit.

You will find a description of every step in this file in the section **Steps**

## Steps

Following every step needed to installable PWA.
